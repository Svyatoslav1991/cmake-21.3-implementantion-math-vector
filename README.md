Task 21-3. Implementation of a mathematical vector

Implement the structure of a two-dimensional mathematical vector and basic operations on it. Both vector coordinates (x and y) must be real numbers.

At the beginning of the program, the user enters a command that corresponds to the required operation. Further, depending on the operation, the user enters its arguments. It can be both vectors and ordinary, scalar values. As a result, the result is placed on the standard output. It can also be either a vector or a scalar.

Implement the following operations as separate functions:
addition of two vectors - the add command;
subtraction of two vectors - the subtract command;
multiplication of a vector by a scalar - the scale command;
finding the length of a vector - the length command;
vector normalization â€” normalize command.
